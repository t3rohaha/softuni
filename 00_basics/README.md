# Programming Basics

The course "Programming Basics" provides introductory skills in programming necessary for all technological disciplines at the Software University.

## Foundation of Computer Programming

__Programming__: Is writing commands which will be executed by a computer.

__Program__: Is a sequence of commands which serve the requirements of the program.

__Source Code__: Is the human readable representation of a program.

__Compilation__: Is the process of translating the source code to binary code, so the computer hardware understands it.

__Console Application__: Is a computer program that interacts with the user through a text based interface known as console.

__Web Application__: Is a computer program that interacts with the user through a web browser over the internet.

## Variables and Data

__Computer__: Is a machine which process data.

__Variable__: Is a container for storing data.

__Declaration__: Is the process of introducting a variable to the compiler.

__Initialization__: Is the process of giving initial value to a variable.

## Operators and Expressions

__Operator__: Is a symbol which allows performing operations on variables and values.

__Expression__: Is a combination of operators, variables and values that result in a value.

__Arithmentic operators__: +, -, *, /, %, ^.

__Comparison Operators__: ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.

__Logical Operators__: !, &&, ||.

## Conditional Statements

__if-statement__: Executes code if a given condition is true.

__else-if-statement__: Executes code if a given condition is true and all preceeding statements are false.

__else-statement__: Executes a code if all preceeding statemets are false.

__switch-case__: Executes code based on a given value.

## Variable Lifetime and Scope

__Variable Lifetime__: Is a period during which a variable exists.

__Variable Scope__: Is a part of the code where a variable can be accessed.

## Integrated Development Environment

__IDE__: Software application which provides centralized environment for sofware development.

__Debugger__: A tool that allow developers to inspect their code while executing.

__Build Automation__: Automating the process of building and running the application.

__Project Management__: Facilitates orginizing and managing project files, such as creating, opening and saving projects.

## Control Statements

__for loop__: Control statement that executes a block of code for a given number of times.

__while loop__: Control statement that executes a block of repeatedly until a given condition is true.

__do-while loop__: Similar to while loop but always executes atleast once.
