# Programming Basics

The course "Programming Basics" provides introductory skills in programming
necessary for all technological disciplines at the Software University.

## Foundation of Computer Programming

- `Programming`Is writing commands which will be executed by a computer.

- `Program` Is a sequence of commands which serve the requirements of the
program.

- `Source code` Is the human readable representation of a program.

- `Compilation` Is the process of translating the source code to binary code,
so the computer hardware understands it.

- `Console Application` Is a computer program that interacts with the user
through a text based interface known as console.

- `Web Application` Is a computer program that interacts with the user through
a web browser over the internet.

## Variables and Data

- `Computer` Is a machine which process data.

- `Variable` Is a container for storing data.

- `Declaration` Is the process of introducting a variable to the compiler.

- `Initialization` Is the process of giving initial value to a variable.

## Operators and Expressions

- `Operator` Is a symbol which allows performing operations on variables and
values.

- `Expression` Is a combination of operators, variables and values that result
in a value.

- `Arithmetic Operators` +, -, *, /, %, ^.

- `Comparison Operators` ==, !=, >, >=, <, <=.

- `Logical Operators` !, &&, ||.

- `Ternary Operator` An operator which involves three operands. Examples for
ternary operators are `number % 2 == 0` and `condition ? true : false`.

## Conditional Statements

- `if` Executes code if a given condition is true.

- `else-if` Executes code if a given condition is true and all
preceeding statements are false.

- `else` Executes a code if all preceeding statemets are false.

- `switch` Executes code based on a given value.

## Variable Lifetime and Scope

- `Variable lifetime` Is a period during which a variable exists.

- `Variable scope` Is a part of the code where a variable can be accessed.

## Integrated Development Environment

- `IDE` Software application which provides centralized environment for sofware
development.

- `Debugger` A tool that allow developers to inspect their code while
executing.

- `Build Automation` Automating the process of building and running the
application.

- `Project Management` Facilitates orginizing and managing project files, such
as creating, opening and saving projects.

## Control Statements

- `for loop` Control statement that executes a block of code for a given number
of times.

- `while loop` Control statement that executes a block of repeatedly until a
given condition is true.

- `do-while loop` Similar to while loop but always executes atleast once.
